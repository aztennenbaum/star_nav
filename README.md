#IMU-Camera Calibration using Kalibr
The files listed above is to prepare the IMU-Camera combination for kalibr. Kalibr uses ROS, which is too heavy to run on the Raspberry Pi. Therefore, timestamped IMU data and images are collected using kalibry.py to be later transfered to a machine running ROS.
